# gCastle

[中文版本](./README.cn.md)

Version 1.0.1 released.

## Introduction

`gCastle` is a causal structure learning toolchain developed by [Huawei Noah's Ark Lab](https://www.noahlab.com.hk/#/home). The package contains various functionality related to causal learning and evaluation, including:

* Data generation and processing: data simulation, data reading operators, and data pre-processing operators（such as prior injection and variable selection).
* Causal structure learning: causal structure learning methods, including both classic and recently developed methods, especially gradient-based ones that can handle large problems.
* Evaluation metrics: various commonly used metrics for causal structure learning, including F1, SHD, FDR, TPR, FDR, NNZ, etc.

## Next Up & Contributing

This is the first released version of `gCastle`, we'll be continuously complementing and optimizing the code and documentation. The following items are the main additions planned to be released in the next version (~late June 2021):

* A more sound documentation: including introductions to each algorithm, a guide on how to quickly design an experiment/test using the 'gCastle' tools, more easily readable APIs, etc.
* Extension of the algorithm library: add new algorithms including `GES`, `HPCI`, and `TTPM`, and easily configurable scripts to help learn causal structures using the corresponding algorithms.
* Real-world datasets: add a couple of interesting time series and event sequences datasets collected from AIOPS scenarios where the true graphs are obtained based on expertise.

We welcome new contributors of all experience levels. If you have any questions or suggestions (such as, contributing new algorithms, optimizing code, improving documentation), please submit an issue here. We will reply as soon as possible.
